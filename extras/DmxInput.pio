; PIO program for inputting the DMX lighting protocol.
; (Almost) compliant with ANSI E1.11-2008 (R2018)
; The program assumes a PIO clock frequency of exactly 1MHz

.program DmxInput
.define dmx_bit 4                     ; As DMX has a baudrate of 250.000kBaud, a single bit is 4us

break_reset:
    set x, 29                         ; Setup a counter to count the iterations on break_loop

break_loop:                           ; Break loop lasts for 8us. The entire break must be minimum 30*3us = 90us
    jmp pin break_reset               ; Go back to start if pin goes high during the break
    jmp x-- break_loop   [1]          ; Decrease the counter and go back to break loop if x>0 so that the break is not done
    wait 1 pin 0                      ; Stall until line goes high for the Mark-After-Break (MAB) 

.wrap_target
    wait 0 pin 0                      ; Stall until start bit is asserted
    set x, 7             [dmx_bit]    ; Preload bit counter, then delay until halfway through

bitloop:
    in pins, 1                        ; Shift data bit into ISR
    jmp x-- bitloop      [dmx_bit-2]  ; Loop 8 times, each loop iteration is 4us
    wait 1 pin 0                      ; Wait for pin to go high for stop bits
    in NULL, 24                       ; Push 24 more bits into the ISR so that our one byte is at the position where the DMA expects it
    push                              ; Should probably do error checking on the stop bits some time in the future....
